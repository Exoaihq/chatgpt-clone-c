It's not possible to directly convert this Django code to C, as Django is a web framework built on top of Python, and it doesn't have an equivalent in C. However, if you need to create a simple C program that prints a message, you can use the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This code will print "Hello, World!" to the console. Note that this is not a direct conversion of the Django code, but a simple C program to demonstrate basic functionality.
