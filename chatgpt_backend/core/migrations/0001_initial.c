It's not possible to directly convert this Django migration code to C, as Django is a web framework specifically designed for Python and relies on Python's features and libraries. Additionally, Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and migration system are not available in C.

If you want to work with databases in C, you can use a library like SQLite or MySQL Connector/C, but the code structure and implementation will be significantly different from the Django code provided.
