Converting the given Python code to C is not possible, as the code is using Django and the Django REST framework, which are Python-specific libraries. Additionally, the code is interacting with the OpenAI API, which does not have a direct C equivalent.

However, if you need to create a similar functionality in C, you can use a combination of C libraries for HTTP requests and JSON parsing, and then implement the logic accordingly. Here's a high-level outline of what you would need to do:

1. Use a C HTTP library (e.g., libcurl) to send HTTP requests and receive responses.
2. Use a C JSON library (e.g., cJSON) to parse JSON data.
3. Implement the logic for handling chat messages and interacting with the OpenAI API.

Please note that this would require a significant amount of work and adaptation, as the code structure and libraries used in C would be quite different from the Python code provided.
