It's not possible to directly convert this Python code to C, as Django is a Python web framework and cannot be used in C. However, you can create a simple "Hello, World!" program in C as an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This C code is not equivalent to the provided Python code, but it demonstrates a simple C program.
