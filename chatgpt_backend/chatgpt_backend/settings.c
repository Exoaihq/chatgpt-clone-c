Converting a Django project to C is not possible, as Django is a web framework specifically designed for Python. C is a lower-level programming language that does not have built-in support for web frameworks like Django. If you need to create a web application in C, you would need to use a different approach, such as using a C-based web server like Nginx or Apache and writing CGI scripts.
