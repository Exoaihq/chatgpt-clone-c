Converting Django WSGI code to C is not possible, as Django is a web framework specifically designed for Python, and WSGI is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface. C does not have a direct equivalent for this code. However, if you are looking for a simple "Hello, World!" program in C, here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

If you need a web server in C, you might want to look into libraries like libevent or libuv.
