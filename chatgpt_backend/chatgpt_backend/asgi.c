Converting Django ASGI configuration to C is not possible, as Django is a Python web framework and cannot be directly translated to C. However, if you need a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!", you can use the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Please let me know if you need help with a different task in C.
